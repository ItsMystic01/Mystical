General feedback:
/ 1. Watch where you declare your variables. Sometimes you create new objects unnecessarily. Ex: In the function playerRankChat(), you create a new manager every time it's called. Ex2: You create new managers every time a player chats or joins the server in your listeners. Pass them into the constructor and use only one instance if only one is needed.

/ 2. When creating your manager classes, they should be passed into the constructor. ex: Create ONE ChatFunctions object and pass it to all classes who need it instead of creating a new one and initializing it inside the constructor. This makes code more flexible in case you ever decide to create a new chat-related class.

3. Make more things configurable using a config.yml and/or lang.yml.

/ 4. Package organization is unclear. You have a commands package, but also have give/remove coins commands inside the economy package.

5. Don't hardcode permission strings. Permissions should be listed in the plugin.yml, and then hardcoded inside an ENUM class. Then use the enum in your code. This makes it easier to find unused permissions or change the strings later on (This is important if you plan for this plugin to become rather large).

/ 6. Code duplication - pay and give coins are basically the same with the only difference being 'pay' must take that balance from another player. You can move common error checks (like argument checking) to another class.

/ 7. PlayerInfoManager is slow because you use a List to store the info, and then loop through all the players every time a lookup is done. Make your list into a HashMap instead.

8. Add more comments. I didn't see any comments... so I'm hoping that's an exportation to Github issue or something. If you just don't have comments... take some time and add them. All functions should have a javadoc comment describing what it does. Additional comments in code should explain why it's doing what it's doing.
